# Bike Buyers Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this analysis was to understand the purchasing patterns of bike buyers to help businesses optimize their marketing and product design.
The dataset contained 1,000+ records with demographic, income, commute distance, and purchasing information.

**Tools Used:** Excel, PostgreSQL, Power BI

---

## Problem Statement
A retail bike company wanted to identify:
1. Which demographic groups are most likely to purchase bikes.
2. How commute distance impacts buying decisions.
3. Opportunities for targeted marketing and product customization.

---

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates in Excel
   - Standardized categorical variables (e.g., “M” → “Married”)
   - Created Age Brackets from given customer ages
2. **Data Analysis in SQL**  
   - Aggregated purchase patterns by age, gender, and commute distance  
   - Calculated purchase percentages  
3. **Visualization in Power BI**  
   - Built interactive dashboards for age brackets, income, and commute patterns.

---

## Key Insights
- **41.6%** of customers live within 0–1 miles from work — opportunity to focus marketing on short-distance commuters.  
- **38.1%** of buyers are aged 31–54 — product designs and colors should cater to this age group.  
- Married customers had a slightly higher average income and purchase rate.  

---

## Business Recommendations
- Launch “Eco-Commute” marketing campaigns targeting customers living ≤1 mile from work.
- Introduce commuter-friendly bike models with comfort-oriented features for mid-aged professionals.
- Offer seasonal promotions in areas with high short-distance commuting.
